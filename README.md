Some working Drupal modules showing basic angular.js working,
and angular.js working with router.ui

NOTE:  in the home directory of Drupal I created a directory routerui_templates
  then in that directory is a list of relative links to directories corresponding to the custom modules
  that use angular and router.ui
  so for example from within the routerui_templates directory I created the relative link:
  ln -s ../sites/all/modules/custom/routerui_test/routerui_test_templates routerui_test_templates
